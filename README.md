# GDXvania: An Arcade-Style Homage to Castlevania

This project is a fan-made, arcade-style interpretation of the classic Castlevania series, developed as a university assignment. It is built using the [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) game development framework, leveraging the project structure generated by [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff).

## Scope of the Project

This project aims to recreate the core gameplay loop and atmosphere of classic Castlevania games in a simplified, arcade-friendly format. Key aspects explored include:

* **Simplified Controls:** Implementing intuitive and responsive controls suitable for quick, action-oriented gameplay.
* **Single Screen Design:** The game takes place on a single, focused screen
* **Linear Progression to Boss Encounter:** Focusing on raising the score culminating in a challenging boss fight.
* **Combat Mechanics:** Developing engaging combat against iconic monsters using a primary weapon and potentially sub-weapons.
* **Atmospheric Presentation:** Evoking the dark and gothic aesthetic of Castlevania through visuals and sound.

**Please note that this is a non-commercial, educational project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Konami Digital Entertainment.**


## Platform Support

This project currently supports the following platforms:

* `core`: Contains the main game logic, shared across all platforms.
* `lwjgl3`: For desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
* `android`: For Android mobile devices (WIP).
* `html`: For web browsers, utilizing GWT and WebGL.

## Acknowledgements - Important Notice Regarding Assets

**It is crucial to understand and acknowledge that all visual assets (sprites, backgrounds, logos), music, and sound effects used in this project are not original creations.** They are used for educational and demonstrative purposes only and are the intellectual property of their respective owners, primarily Konami Digital Entertainment.

This project is a work of fan art and is intended as a learning experience in game development. No claim of ownership is made over any of the aforementioned assets.


## Gradle Build System

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.
The Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.
Useful Gradle tasks and flags:

- `--continue`: when using this flag, errors will not stop the tasks from running.
- `--daemon`: thanks to this flag, Gradle daemon will be used to run chosen tasks.
- `--offline`: when using this flag, cached dependency archives will be used.
- `--refresh-dependencies`: this flag forces validation of all dependencies. Useful for snapshot versions.
- `android:lint`: performs Android project validation.
- `build`: builds sources and archives of every project.
- `cleanEclipse`: removes Eclipse project data.
- `cleanIdea`: removes IntelliJ project data.
- `clean`: removes `build` folders, which store compiled classes and built archives.
- `eclipse`: generates Eclipse project data.
- `html:dist`: compiles GWT sources. The compiled application can be found at `html/build/dist`: you can use any HTTP server to deploy it.
- `html:superDev`: compiles GWT sources and runs the application in SuperDev mode. It will be available at [localhost:8080/html](http://localhost:8080/html). Use only during development.
- `idea`: generates IntelliJ project data.
- `lwjgl3:jar`: builds application's runnable jar, which can be found at `lwjgl3/build/libs`.
- `lwjgl3:run`: starts the application.
- `test`: runs unit tests (if any).

Note that most tasks that are not specific to a single project can be run with `name:` prefix, where the `name` should be replaced with the ID of a specific project.
For example, `core:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `core` project.
